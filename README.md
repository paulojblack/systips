Greets you with linux related informational string, link to a useful utility, or shortcut upon logging into a new shell.

Written in Golang. Under development

## Testing
`go test ./...`

## TODO
- Add meta-information to each tip, such as a subcategory (networking, efficiency etc.) and "level" (beginner, intermediate, advanced)
- Look in to text formatting of stdout
